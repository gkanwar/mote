Example 1
=========
k, q, p === 4-momenta, have 1 Lorentz index
Integral_k[Integral_q[d^dk d^dq / (2PI)^2d * 1 / (k^2 * (k-q)^2 ... ]]

* Variables have scope
* Operators defined to commute in certain ways
* Operators can be linear
* Lorentz indices contraction
* Define integral simplification forms
* Gamma functions?
